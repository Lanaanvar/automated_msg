#AutoGreetings

In this project, we address the challenge of remembering and sending timely birthday wishes to a large network of individuals. Using the avilable technologies, we have developed a system that generates and sends messages on their behalf.

Auto-greetings is an innovative web application designed to automate the process of sending birthday wishes to friends, family, and colleagues. With the aim of making birthdays more special and hassle-free, our platform harnesses the power of automation..

The core functionality of Auto-greetings includes a simple user interface where users can manage their contacts and preferences. By integrating with social media platforms and contact lists, our application automatically gathers and updates birthday information. Using this data, the system generates and sends greetings to the individual.

By utilising APIs and scheduling mechanisms, the platform automatically dispatches the birthday wishes via  social media, ensuring they reach the recipients precisely when they are most meaningful.

Auto-greetings not only simplifies the process of remembering and sending birthday wishes but also aims to bring joy and strengthen personal connections. By automating routine tasks, users can focus on deeper interactions and spend quality time with their loved ones.

Our team members Lana Anvar, Lakshmikha Rejith and Meghna K M collectively worked on this project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript for frontend and MySql for backend.

In conclusion, auto-greetings is a powerful web application that streamlines the process of sending birthday wishes. Through automation we aim to make birthdays more special and effortless, fostering stronger relationships and spreading happiness.
